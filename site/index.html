            <h5>Steps followed for fetching table data</h5>
            <p>
                After subscribing to <code>/fx/prices</code>, I am able to get data continously. Then filtered the raw data
                to find unique names. Grouped the data with same names, then filtered to get the bestLastChangedBid of each
                name. Then sorted the data and displayed as table body which updates on every 5 seconds.
            </p>
            <h5>Steps followed for generating Sparkline</h5>
            <p>
                From the raw data found out the midpoints. All the points having same name are grouped and stored in an array.<br/>                Then generated the sparkline by filtering the latest points and displayed in last column of the table
            </p>
        </div>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For better understanding of work flow, entire javascript code was written in <code>index.js</code> file
                    only
                </li>
                <li>
                    Commented each line to the best of my knowledge
                </li>
                <li>
                    Not applied any CSS

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Same assignment can be done in better and efficient way using React and Redux
                </li>
                <li>
                    React concept is meant to render the individual components, so we can generate and manage sparkline seperately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also instead of setInterval we can just watch for an update and display data using react component life cycle methods.
                </li>
            </ul>
